## Survival Remastered 3.0 Pre Alpha


If you find any issues or crashes, report it on the GitHub issue tracker.

**WARNING: UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION *WILL* BREAK WORLDS**

Survival Remastered 3.0 aims to fix most if not all problems of earlier versions of the modpack.
This update is a complete overhaul of the modpack, and as such, it is not recommended to update existing worlds.

I will not be providing any support whatsoever for users attempting to use worlds from previous versions of Survival Remastered,
as the modpack has been entirely rewritten.

The final version of Survival Remastered 3.0 will be on a 1.20 version. The "alpha" releases will start only after 1.20 is released,
so that is the reason this is counted as a pre alpha, as the modpack may need to be partially rewritten when porting to 1.20.

This release will initially not have a changelog due to the sheer amount of changes made.
Future alphas and betas will have changelogs.
