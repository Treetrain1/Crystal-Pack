**WARNING: UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION *WILL* BREAK WORLDS**

Survival Remastered 3.0 aims to fix most if not all problems of earlier versions of the modpack.
This update is a complete overhaul of the modpack, and as such, it is likely not possible to update existing worlds.

The final version of Survival Remastered 3.0 will be on a 1.20 version.

This release will not have a detailed changelog due to the drastic amount of changes made.
Future alphas and betas will have changelogs.
